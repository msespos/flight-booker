# FLIGHT BOOKER

This is an application developed as part of my work with the Odin Project.

Flight Booker is a site for booking airline flights. Users can search for flights given their search parameters, select their flight and book it with multiple passengers. 

The Odin Project Flight Booker spec can be found here:
