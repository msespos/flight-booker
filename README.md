# FLIGHT BOOKER

This is an application developed as part of my work with the Odin Project.

Flight Booker is a site for booking airline flights. Users can search for flights given their search parameters, select their flight and book it with multiple passengers. 

Check it out [here](https://pure-eyrie-10894.herokuapp.com/).

The Odin Project Flight Booker spec can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/flight-booker).
